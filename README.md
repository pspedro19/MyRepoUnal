# Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance of H501 Refinery Furnace

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to use machine learning tools to predict unplanned shutdowns of the H501 unit in the Apiay refinery. By implementing predictive analytics and principal component analysis, we aim to prevent unplanned plant downtimes, ensure service continuity, and maintain product quality to meet specifications.

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict unplanned furnace shutdowns. We will integrate data from the H501 unit with SIS data to correlate with the target variable (furnace shutdown), perform data cleaning, exploratory and statistical analysis, and data imputation as necessary.
